2.5 seconds?  decay to 5?

linear decay

first time - 50/50
last - 1/50

laser is ~14.705 per second
ackermann is ~29.076 per second

~110000 iterations for error under 0.1
150000
175000
220000

concerns of overfitting?

removing third convolution layer?
apparently faster training and still as accurate

syncing clocks:
- `sudo service ntp start` on tk1
- `./sync.sh` on tk2

running:
- `roscore` on tk1
- `roslaunch avc tk1_teleop.launch` on tk1
- `roslaunch avc tk2_teleop.launch` on tk2
- `roslaunch avc tk1_sensors.launch` on tk1

duplicate teleop launch file

speed values are 0 to 2, I was driving at 0.4 or 0.5

note - normalize input, denormalize output
