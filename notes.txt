2.5 seconds?  decay to 5?

linear decay

first time - 50/50
last - 1/50

laser is ~14.705 per second
ackermann is ~29.076 per second

~110000 iterations for error under 0.1
150000
175000
220000

concerns of overfitting?

removing third convolution layer?
apparently faster training and still as accurate
